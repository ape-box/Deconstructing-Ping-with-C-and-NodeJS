# All the C examples

To run this code there is a Makefile with simple shorcuts

- sudo make: will compile the Bare Minimum file
- sudo make struct: will compile the Struct Response file
- sudo make check: will compile the Checksum file.
- sudo make clean: of corse will remove the binary file after compilation.

You can use the following combo `sudo make && sudo ./ping.out && make clean` to:

1. compile
2. run the code
3. delete the unecesary file
